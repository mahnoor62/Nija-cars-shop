# Public Folder

This folder contains static assets that are served directly by Next.js.

## Current Placeholder Files

- `placeholder-1.jpg` - Generic placeholder image
- `placeholder-2.png` - Generic placeholder image  
- `hero-image.jpg` - Hero section image placeholder
- `product-1.jpg` - Product image placeholder
- `product-2.jpg` - Product image placeholder
- `logo.svg` - Logo placeholder

## Usage

These are placeholder files that you can replace with actual images. In Next.js, you can reference these images in your components like:

```jsx
import Image from 'next/image'

<Image src="/hero-image.jpg" alt="Hero" width={800} height={400} />
```

## Note

Replace these placeholder files with actual image files when you're ready to use real images in your project.
